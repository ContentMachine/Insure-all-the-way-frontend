          Building Insurance covers the structure of a property, including
          walls, roofs, and permanent fixtures, against risks like fire, storms,
          and vandalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          It ensures property owners can repair or rebuild after damage but
          doesnâ€™t cover contents inside, which require separate insurance
